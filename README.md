For the-oof-button to work, you must extract the folder from the .zip file.
-

If you are using this with Windows, right click the file and it should say "Extract."

If you have a Chromebook, the .zip file will have an eject button - double click the file, then hit it. 
If that does not work, open the zip file and you should see a regular folder with a title that is the same as the zip file name. Simply drag that folder somewhere else, and it should be working.
