For "theoofbutton" to work via download, you must extract the folder from the .zip file.
-
If you are using this with Windows or Linux, right click the file and it should say "Extract." 
After extracting, open the .html file from the unzipped file.

If you have a Chromebook, the .zip file will have an eject button - double click the file, then hit it.
If that does not work, open the zip file and you should see a regular folder with a title that is the same as the zip file name.
Simply drag that folder somewhere else, and it should be working.

If you are using an Apple product, it will not work via download. Instead, visit the respository website link.
